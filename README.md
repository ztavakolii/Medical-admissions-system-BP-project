## Description:
+ In this project, a medical admission system program has been implemented using structured programming with C language.

+ After running the program, you must first log in as the office secretary using the username and password "Admin". Then you can create accounts for office doctors and patients using their username and email address. Then you can go back to the first page and enter the forgot password section as a doctor or patient and choose or change a password by entering your username and email address that the secretary registered for you in the system.
Now you can enter the program in different roles such as secretary, doctor or patient and use the program facilities for each person.
